# Blacklight

Blacklight is an incredibly simple Forge mod which stops the horizon from turning black below y=62. It achieves this with a single mixin file that modifies the `WorldRenderer` class.

# Uses

There are many reasons you may want to use Blacklight. For example, if you're using the Floating Islands world preset, or if you're playing a map that contains floating islands, you may find the blazk horizon annoying.

# License

Because Blacklight consists of only one real snippet of code, it is licensed under the Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License. Like the name of the license suggests, you may do whatever you want to with the code.
